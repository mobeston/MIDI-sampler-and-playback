# MIDI-sampler-and-playback

This is the code for a single-input serial port for Altera's Complex Programmable logic Device(CPLD) MAX 7000S. The Device is connected 8 led's to display the note number(MIDI) that is being played since every note is represented by a byte.

This project has its own electronic component but this is the code to program to read the note comming in from the midi receiver into the device and the note being played at the moment is displayed in the binary number form.
